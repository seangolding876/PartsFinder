# 🚀 Deploy PartsFinda to Netlify - Step by Step

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist
Your project is READY for deployment with:
- ✅ All API keys configured (Stripe, Cloudinary, Resend, Supabase)
- ✅ Build tested and working
- ✅ 34 pages and 15 API endpoints ready
- ✅ Authentication system functional
- ✅ Payment processing in test mode

## 📋 Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Open terminal in the `partsfinda` directory and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - PartsFinda marketplace with configured APIs"
```

---

## 📋 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `partsfinda`
   - Description: "Jamaica's Auto Parts Marketplace"
   - Keep it **Private** initially (you can make it public later)
   - Do NOT initialize with README (we already have files)

3. After creating, you'll see instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/partsfinda.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
5. Select the `partsfinda` repository
6. **Build settings will auto-populate from netlify.toml:**
   - Build command: `bun install && bun run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
7. Click **"Deploy site"**

### Option B: Via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally

If you own partsfinda.com:

1. In Netlify dashboard → **Domain settings**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter `partsfinda.com`
